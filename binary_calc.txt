Algorithm for Decimal to Binary Conversion in C
Step 1: Divide the number by 2 and find the remainder, then store the remainder in an array.

Step 2: Divide the number by 2.

Step 3: Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.

Step 4: Print the array in reverse order to get the binary representation of the number.
